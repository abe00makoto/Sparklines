Sparklines - an iOS Custom View Implementation
----------------------------------------------

 Sparklines are small, word-sized graphics showing historical values for a
measured data item.They were described by Edward Tufte in his 1982 book "The
Visual Display of Quantitative Information", and are designed to represent
a lot of data in a small space.

 This project is an iOS custom view implementation of sparklines, and is
released under the BSD license. While the custom view consists of two
Objective-C files, the code is provided as a complete iOS Xcode project that
will build and run on Xcode V4.1 or greater (it will probably build and run
under earlier versions but I haven't confirmed that). Both the iPhone/iPod
Touch and the iPad is supported by this demo.

 Please read the embedded documentation in the SparklineView.h file; a
doxygen config file is also provided, so you can build your own HTML
documentation, which includes a graphical explanation of what sparklines
are.
